## Hola, soy Neil Peña Martínez.

I have programming as my _personal unpaid job_. I am a newcomer to this cosmos, although I aspire to go far despite coming from a different area of expertise. In short, I try to thrive in what seems to be too great for me, but I do not mistake ambition for hubris.
<br>

### My go-to technologies
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS
- **Data Science**: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git
- **IDEs**: VSCode, Eclipse

All in all, these are the programming languages, libraries, and tools I am _at least_ acquainted with, presented without any specific hierarchy based on expertise, preference, or frequency of use:

And here are the ones I aspire to learn:

Practice takes time, but it also takes motive, and I do not know which of the two is harder to find. I will have to make do.
