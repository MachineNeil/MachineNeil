## Hola, soy Neil Peña Martínez.

I have programming as my _personal unpaid job_. I am a newcomer to this cosmos, although I aspire to go far despite coming from another, mostly unrelated area of knowledge. In short, I try to thrive in what seems to be too great for me, but I do not mistake ambition for hubris.

These are the programming languages and tools I utilize, presented without any specific hierarchy based on expertise, preference, or frequency:

  </a>

And here are the ones I aspire to learn:

  </a>

Practice takes time, but it also takes motive, and I do not know which of the two is harder to find. I will have to make do.
